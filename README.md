## Seminar of Geometry final project by Chen Mengyi
In 2021 fall semester, I enrolled in the course Seminar by Geometry by Prof. Duan Haibao. We adopt the *Topology from the Differrential Viewpoint* and *Morse Theory* by John Milnor. Milnor's books are concise but instructive. In the final project, I analyze the Brower degree in differential topology, and prove that in fact the rotation index in differential geometry and the winding number in complex analysis are special cases of Brower degree.
